            <h2>Common Concerns & How I Help</h2>
            <p>You might have some questions or worries. That's completely normal! Here's how I address them:</p>

            <div class="concern-box">
                <strong>Concern: "Will it block ads in social media apps like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok?"</strong>
                <p>This is a common question! Pi-hole blocks ads by preventing your devices from connecting to known ad-serving domains.
                   <br>- For <strong>web browser versions</strong> of these platforms (e.g., watching YouTube on Chrome), Pi-hole is quite effective at blocking banner and pre-roll video ads.
                   <br>- For <strong>mobile apps</strong> (like the YouTube, Facebook, or Instagram app), it's more challenging. These apps often serve ads from the same domains as their main content, or use deeply integrated ad systems. Blocking these aggressively can sometimes cause parts of the app to not display or function correctly.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">Solution: While Pi-hole may not eliminate every single ad within these specific mobile apps (especially in-video ads on YouTube or sponsored posts in feeds), it will still significantly reduce ads on countless other websites, in many other apps, and across your entire network. You'll see a dramatic decrease in general web browsing ads, pop-ups, and trackers. For a more aggressive approach on specific apps, per-device solutions might still be needed, but Pi-hole provides a fantastic baseline of protection and cleanliness for your whole home.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="concern-box">
                <strong>Concern: "Will it cause issues with some websites or apps I use?"</strong>
                <p>Occasionally, a website or app might rely on a domain that Pi-hole blocks, which could prevent some content from loading or a feature from working as expected. This is rare for essential functions.</p>
                <p class="solution">Solution: I'll show you how to easily "whitelist" (allow) specific sites or temporarily disable Pi-hole if needed. It's a simple click! Plus, I'll help configure initial whitelists for common services during setup to minimize any interruptions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concern-box">
                <strong>Concern: "Is it complicated to manage?"</strong>
                <p>The idea of new network hardware or software can sound daunting if you're not tech-savvy.</p>
                <p class="solution">Solution: Pi-hole is mostly "set it and forget it" after the initial setup. I'll handle the entire installation and configuration. I'll also give you a simple walkthrough of its web interface so you feel comfortable. And I'm available for follow-up questions!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="concern-box">
                <strong>Concern: "What if I *want* to see an ad for a specific product or support a creator?"</strong>
                <p>You might occasionally want to allow ads on a particular site or for a short period.</p>
                <p class="solution">Solution: You can temporarily disable Pi-hole for a few minutes with a couple of clicks. I'll show you exactly how. It's very straightforward.</p>
            </div>
             <p><strong>My Commitment:</strong> My goal is to make this easy and beneficial for you. I'm not just installing software; I'm providing a service to improve your internet experience, and I'll be there to help you get comfortable with it.</p>
